This simple low-level implementation assumes a single connection for a single thread. Thus, a static
variable is used for that connection.
On other scenarios, the user must solve this by taking into account that the current implementation of
MQTTPacket_read() has a function pointer for a function call to get the data to a buffer, but no provisions
to know the caller or other indicator (the socket id): int (*getfn)(unsigned char*, int)
